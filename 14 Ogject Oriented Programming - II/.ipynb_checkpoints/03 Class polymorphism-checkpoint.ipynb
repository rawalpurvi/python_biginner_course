    "### Class polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"polymorphism\" means \"many forms\", and in programming it refers to methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes. Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have multiple classes with the same method name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, say we have three classes: Car, Boat, and Plane, and they all derived fron parent class Vehicle and have a method called move()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Child classes inherits the properties and methods from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Car class is empty, but it inherits brand, model, and move() from Vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Boat and Plane classes also inherit brand, model, and move() from Vehicle, but they both override the move() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of polymorphism we can execute the same method for all classes."
