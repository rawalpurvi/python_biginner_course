    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling is an important part of any web application. Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a New File\n",
    "\n",
    "The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function. The open() function takes main two parameters; filename, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"r\" -** Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist\n",
    "* **\"a\" -** Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "* **\"w\" -** Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist\n",
    "* **\"x\" -** Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"t\" -** Text - Default value. Text mode\n",
    "* **\"b\" -** Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "f = open(\"test.txt\") # Define without any mode\n",
    "\n",
    "f = open(\"test.txt\",\"rt\") # \"r\"  for reading and  \"t\"  for text file "

    "To write to an existing file, you must add a parameter to the open() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"a\" -** Append - will append to the end of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "* **\"w\" -** Write - will overwrite any existing content\n",
